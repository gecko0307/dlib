# Code of Conduct

This project welcomes contributions in any form and encourages open discussion and exchange of views on its features, architecture, and implementation details. To maintain a proper culture of communication, this Code of Conduct has been formulated. It applies to the project's issue tracker, chat, and possibly other communication channels.

1. We do not tolerate obscene language, insulting, rude and/or disparaging messages, the use of sexualized, violent and otherwise offensive speech and imagery.
2. Any criticism should be constructive and reasonable. Mere personal discontent without any objective reasoning is not enough to make critical statements and influence the development of dlib.
3. This project stays away from non-technological issues and topics. We welcome everyone, regardless of age, gender identity, religion, ethnicity, citizenship, or cultural background, and our community do not conduct any specific ideology. Sites, repositories, communication channels and other resources associated with dlib should not be used as a platform for propaganda.
