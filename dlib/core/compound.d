 * Compile-time sequence (aka tuple) + struct hybrid
 *
 * Description:
 * This template can be used to construct data types on the fly 
 * and return them from functions, which cannot be done with pure compile-time sequence.
 * One possible use case for such types is returning result and error message 
 * from function instead of throwing an exception.
